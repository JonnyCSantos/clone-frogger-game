# Clone Frogger Game

Developed for Udacity **Advanced Front-end Nanodegree**. This is a clone of the classic fliperama game *"Frogger"*. In this version, instead of the famous little frog, we counted on the presence of 5 pesonagens that guarantee the same fun. Reach the water to get more points, and if you happen to die on the course, do not get discouraged. Beat your record! ;)

## Running the game
To start the game is simple. Just download the ZIP file, extract it and run the index.html file in your browser.

## Game Play
* Select a character and try to hit the water to get more points.
* Avoid the enemies of the game, otherwise you will reset your score and start from scratch.
* Overcome your own RECORD and challenge your friends to this adventure.

## Controls
* Use the arrow keys (left, top, right, bottom) on the keyboard to move the character.

## Credits
* Art and engine.js provided by Udacity.
